## About Me
My research mainly focuses on deep learning, multimedia computing, and intelligent human-computer interaction. To be specific, my research areas cover cross-modal learning, imbalanced learning, visual representation learning, and physiological signal analysis. <br>
I received my Ph.D. from the School of Software at Shandong University (SDU) in June 2024, under the supervision of Prof. Lei Meng and Prof. Xiangxu Meng. From 2020 to 2024, I worked on cross-modal learning in long-tailed classification with the MMRC team at SDU. Prior to that, between 2018 and 2020, I researched personalized user interface recommendation at SDU. I earned my Bachelor's degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in June 2018.
