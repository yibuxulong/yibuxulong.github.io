## About Me
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [School of Mechanical, Electrical & Information Engineering](https://ie.wh.sdu.edu.cn/index.htm), Shandong University (SDU), working with Assoc. Prof. [Juan Liu](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/liujuan5) and Assoc. Prof. [Yulong Bian](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/bianyulong1/zh_CN/index.htm), and my cooperative supervisor is Prof. Yunfeng Bi.

I received my Ph.D. from the School of Software at SDU in June 2024, under the supervision of Prof. [Lei Meng](https://ercdm.sdu.edu.cn/info/1013/1523.htm) and Prof. [Xiangxu Meng](https://www.sc.sdu.edu.cn/info/1041/2201.htm). From 2020 to 2024, I worked on cross-modal learning in long-tailed classification with the MMRC team at SDU. Prior to that, between 2018 and 2020, I researched personalized user interface recommendation at SDU. I earned my Bachelor's degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in June 2018.

My research mainly focuses on deep learning, multimedia computing, and intelligent human-computer interaction. To be specific, my researches cover cross-modal learning, imbalanced learning, visual representation learning, and physiological signal analysis. <br>

## Research Interests
- **Cross-modal Learning**: visual-semantic alignment, cross-modal inference
- **Imbalanced learning**: long-tailed image/text classification
- **Visual representation learning**: image/video representation learning
- **Physiological signal analysis**: EEG-based flow experience classification
